<!--Task 1: Create a Basic Flexbox Layout Start by creating a simple webpage layout using Flexbox.
 Your layout should include a header, a navigation menu, a main content area, and a footer.
 
 Utilize flex-direction to make sure your navigation menu is reading horizontally 
 and your main content is reading vertically. Requirements for this task:

Navigation Menu should contain at least 3 things (i.e. Home, Profile, About)
 and be arranged horizontally on the top of the page
Header section should contain a background image and header text
Header Text should be bold, contrast color and Centered

Main Content should contain at least 2 different children divs with content
 and be arranged vertically stacked on top of one another
Footer should contain at least 3 sections (i.e. Contact Us, Events, Blog) 
and be arranged horizontally -->


<!--
Task 2: Implement Responsive Design Modify your Flexbox layout 
to include responsive design elements. Use media queries to adjust the layout 
for smaller screens, converting the navigation and footer content areas 
into a column format when the viewport width is less than 600px.

Expected Outcome: The webpage layout adjusts for smaller screens, 
with the navigation and main content side by side, while the header and footer 
span the full width of the viewport.



Task 3: Enhance the Layout with Flexbox Properties Further enhance your layout 
by using Flexbox properties such as justify-content, align-items, and flex-grow. 
Adjust these properties to ensure that the main content area 
takes up the remaining space between the header and footer,
 and centers the content within the navigation and main content areas.-->
